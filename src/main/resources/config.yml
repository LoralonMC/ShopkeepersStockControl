# === Daily Reset Configuration ===
# Use fixed daily reset time instead of rolling cooldowns
# When enabled, all trades reset at the specified time each day
# When disabled, trades use rolling cooldowns (e.g., 24 hours after use)
use_fixed_daily_reset: false

# Daily reset time in 24-hour format (HH:mm) - server timezone
# Examples: "00:00" (midnight), "06:00" (6 AM), "12:00" (noon), "18:00" (6 PM)
# Only applies when use_fixed_daily_reset is true
daily_reset_time: "00:00"

# Cooldown check frequency (in seconds)
# How often to check for expired cooldowns and clean up data
cooldown_check_interval: 60

# Cache time-to-live (seconds)
# Auto-expire shop mappings after this duration (prevents memory leaks from missed events)
cache_ttl: 10

# Batch write interval (seconds)
# How often to flush dirty data to database (reduces disk I/O)
batch_write_interval: 30

# Messages (using MiniMessage format)
# Set any message to "" (empty string) to disable it
#
# Available placeholders:
#   %time_remaining% - Countdown until reset (e.g., "23h 45m", "6d 12h")
#   %reset_time%     - Shows " - Resets at HH:mm" when using fixed daily reset, empty otherwise
#   %remaining%      - Number of trades remaining for the player
#   %max%            - Maximum number of trades allowed
#   %player%         - Player's name
#
# How messages display:
#   With rolling cooldowns: "23h 45m remaining"
#   With fixed daily reset:  "23h 45m remaining - Resets at 00:00"
