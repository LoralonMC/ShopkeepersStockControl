# Trade limits per Shopkeepers shop
# IMPORTANT: Use stable trade keys (not numeric indices)
# This allows you to reorder trades without breaking player data
#
# HOW TO FIND SHOPKEEPER IDs:
# 1. Look in plugins/Shopkeepers/saves.yml for your shopkeeper's unique ID
# 2. Or use /shopkeeper for the shopkeeper you want to track
# 3. The ID will be a UUID like: e8f4a3c2-1234-5678-9abc-def012345678
#
# Format:
# shops:
#   <shopkeeper_uuid>:  # Use the actual Shopkeeper UUID here
#     name: "Display Name"  # Optional: Friendly name shown in /ssc check (defaults to shopkeeper_id)
#     enabled: true
#     respect_shop_stock: false  # true = respect Shopkeepers' finite stock, false = admin shops (infinite)
#     cooldown_mode: daily       # Shop-level default: daily, weekly, or rolling (default: rolling)
#     reset_time: "00:00"        # Shop-level default for daily/weekly: HH:mm (default: "00:00")
#     reset_day: "monday"        # Shop-level default for weekly: day of week (default: "monday")
#     trades:
#       <stable_trade_key>:
#         slot: <number>           # REQUIRED: Position in villager UI (0 = first trade, 1 = second, etc.)
#         max_trades: <number>     # REQUIRED: How many times a player can do this trade
#         cooldown: <seconds>      # Cooldown duration in seconds (required for rolling mode, optional for daily/weekly)
#         cooldown_mode: rolling   # Optional: Override shop-level default for this trade
#         reset_time: "00:00"      # Optional: Override shop-level reset time
#         reset_day: "monday"      # Optional: Override shop-level reset day (weekly only)
#
# COOLDOWN MODES:
#   daily   - Trade resets at reset_time every day (e.g., midnight)
#   weekly  - Trade resets at reset_time on reset_day each week (e.g., Monday midnight)
#   rolling - Trade resets individually X seconds after the player's first trade
#
# HIERARCHY: Per-trade settings override per-shop settings.
# If a trade doesn't specify cooldown_mode/reset_time/reset_day, it inherits from the shop.
# If the shop doesn't specify them either, defaults are: rolling / 00:00 / monday.

# EXAMPLE configurations (replace these with your actual Shopkeeper UUIDs!)
# These are just examples to show the format - they won't work without real IDs
