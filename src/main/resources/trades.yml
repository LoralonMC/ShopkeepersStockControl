# Trade limits per Shopkeepers shop
# IMPORTANT: Use stable trade keys (not numeric indices)
# This allows you to reorder trades without breaking player data
#
# HOW TO FIND SHOPKEEPER IDs:
# 1. Look in plugins/Shopkeepers/saves.yml for your shopkeeper's unique ID
# 2. Or use /shopkeeper for the shopkeeper you want to track
# 3. The ID will be a UUID like: e8f4a3c2-1234-5678-9abc-def012345678
#
# Format:
# shops:
#   <shopkeeper_uuid>:  # Use the actual Shopkeeper UUID here
#     name: "Display Name"  # Optional: Friendly name shown in /ssc check (defaults to shopkeeper_id)
#     enabled: true
#     respect_shop_stock: false  # true = respect Shopkeepers' finite stock, false = admin shops (infinite)
#     trades:
#       <stable_trade_key>:  # Create your own stable identifiers (e.g., "diamond_trade")
#         slot: <number>      # REQUIRED: Position in villager UI (0 = first trade, 1 = second, etc.)
#         max_trades: <number>  # REQUIRED: How many times a player can do this trade
#         cooldown: <seconds>   # REQUIRED: Cooldown duration (86400 = 24 hours, 604800 = 7 days)

# EXAMPLE configurations (replace these with your actual Shopkeeper UUIDs!)
# These are just examples to show the format - they won't work without real IDs
