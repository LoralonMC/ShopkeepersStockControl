# ============================================================
# TRADE LIMITS PER SHOPKEEPERS SHOP
# ============================================================
# IMPORTANT: Use stable trade keys (not numeric indices)
# This allows you to reorder trades without breaking player data
#
# HOW TO FIND SHOPKEEPER IDs:
# 1. Look in plugins/Shopkeepers/saves.yml for your shopkeeper's unique ID
# 2. Or use /shopkeeper for the shopkeeper you want to track
# 3. The ID will be a UUID like: e8f4a3c2-1234-5678-9abc-def012345678
#
# Format:
# shops:
#   <shopkeeper_uuid>:
#     name: "Display Name"
#     enabled: true
#     cooldown-mode: daily
#     reset-time: "00:00"
#     reset-day: "monday"
#     trades:
#       <stable_trade_key>:
#         slot: <number>
#         max-trades: <number>
#         cooldown: <seconds>
#         cooldown-mode: rolling
#         reset-time: "00:00"
#         reset-day: "monday"
#
# COOLDOWN MODES:
#   daily   - Trade resets at reset-time every day (e.g. midnight)
#   weekly  - Trade resets at reset-time on reset-day each week (e.g. Monday midnight)
#   rolling - Trade resets individually X seconds after the player's first trade
#   none    - Never restocks automatically (admin must use /ssc restock)
#
# STOCK MODES:
#   per_player (default) - Each player has independent trade limits
#   shared               - All players share a single stock pool
#
# SHARED MODE OPTIONS:
#   stock-mode: shared
#   max-per-player: <number>   - Optional per-player purchase cap (0 = no cap)
#                                Can be set at shop level (inherited) or per-trade (override)
#
# HIERARCHY: Per-trade settings override per-shop settings.
# If a trade doesn't specify cooldown-mode/reset-time/reset-day, it inherits from the shop.
# If the shop doesn't specify them either, defaults are: rolling / 00:00 / monday.

# EXAMPLE configurations (replace these with your actual Shopkeeper UUIDs!)
# These are just examples to show the format - they won't work without real IDs
